## Instructions/Exercises

- For this assignment you will be creating a grading system for a school. Create a grading system from A-F.
  - A=100-90
  - B=89-80
  - C=79-70
  - D= 69-60
  - F= 59-0
- Create a variable that contains the student’s grade (it should be a number).Then using an if/else statement compare the students grade to the grading system to determine the letter grade the student received.
- Now it is time to create a function that can be reused to return the student’s letter grade. Take the above if/else statement for the grading system and put it into a function. The function should take one parameter and return the student’s letter grade.
- Now let’s update the grading scale to be a bit more complicated. Update the code above to include +/- grades (A+, A-, B+, B-, etc.) update the grading system and if/else statement to return the letter grade including + or -.
- **For bonus:** think about how your function would run if the parameter passed in was not a number, but a string. Look up how to add in test cases to make sure if the function is called but the parameter is not a number it returns an error message instead.
